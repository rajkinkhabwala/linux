Team members contribution :

Sakshi Jain - (Built and install new kernel versions)
Forked the master linux github repository and cloned it locally.
Checked the configurations and versions.
Copied the boot config file locally and creatd a new one.
Build all the new kernel modules.

Raj Kinkhabwala -  (Built and ran the modules that gathers processor capabilities)
Built the new kernel
Install the modules and installed the kernel.
Created the directory and copied the makefile and cmpe233-1.c
Appended the licence info at the end of the cmpe283-1.c file
Intalled and removed the modules and obtained the output

Steps Followed : 

1. Forked the  master linux github (torvalds) repo into this account and cloned it locally into ~/linux, follwed by cd into that new directory.
2. Ran the command 'uname -a' to get the current running linux version.
3. Copied the current config file locally using 'cp /boot/config-5.11.0-37-generic .config'
4. Stored the current local config file into new one using 'make oldconfig'. 
5. Held the enter key to get all new default values.
6. Ran the command 'make prepare'.
7. Once the prepare command was successful, ran the other command 'make -j 8 modules' to build all new kernel modules.
8. Once all kernel modules are availabe ,ran 'make -j 8' command to make the new kernel.
9. After that, installed the modules using 'sudo make INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 modules_install' command.
10. And finally, ran 'sudo make install' to install the kernel.
11. Rebooted the sytem using 'sudo reboot'.

* Built and installed the new kernel version as of now and now below are the steps followed to build and run the modules which tests the preocessor capabilities.

12. Created another folder inside the ~/linux folder using 'mkdir cmpe283' and cd into that directory.
13. Copied the files 'makefile' and 'cmpe283-1.c' provided by professor into that folder.
14. Edited the 'cmpe283-1.c' file by appending the license in that file.
15. Filled the VMX fields in cmpe283-1.c and ran the command 'make'
16. Ran the command 'sudo insmod cmpe283-1.ko' to install the modules.
17. Ran another command to remove the modules 'sudo rmmod cmpe283-1'
18. Finally, ran the comand 'dmesg' to get the output of 'printk' lines.

Final output looks like :
